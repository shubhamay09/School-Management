It allows users to:

1. Add school details via a responsive form with validations and image upload.
2. Store school data in a MySQL database.
3. Fetch and display all schools dynamically in a product-card style layout.

| ----------- | --------- | -------------------------- |
| id          | INT (PK)  | Auto Increment Primary Key |

| contact     | BIGINT    | Contact Number             |
| image       | TEXT      | Image Path or URL          |
| email\_id   | TEXT      | Email ID                   |

I can also prepare a **sample folder structure with README + boilerplate Next.js & Node.js code** so you can directly run and deploy it.

Do you want me to create that as a ZIP file for you?
